Understand customer behavior

Predict who might leave

Help businesses keep more customers

🎯 Goals
Look at customer data to find patterns

Build a model to guess which customers may leave

Show the most important reasons customers leave

Help improve customer retention (keeping customers)

🧰 Tools Used
Python – programming language

Pandas, NumPy – for working with data

Matplotlib, Seaborn – for charts and graphs

Scikit-learn, XGBoost – for machine learning

Streamlit – for making a simple app (optional)
